# 🗂️ DMW-Group-Assignment
## 🗺️ Project Overview:
This repository is part of a group assignment for the Data Mining and Warehousing course (WIE3007) at Universiti Malaya, under the guidance of Dr. Teh Ying Wah. It hosts XML and project files from various tools used in our analysis of the Superstore dataset, a comprehensive public transactional dataset. Our project demonstrates a multi-faceted approach to data mining and warehousing, utilizing a range of software and techniques.  

## 🛠️ Techniques and Tools Employed:
1. **Data Preparation** and **Sampling**: Utilizing  `Talend Data Preparation` and `Talend Data Integration` for initial data handling.
2. **Feature Selection** 🧠: Implementing `Python Featuretools` for Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS), model selection, and recursive feature elimination.
3. **Star Schema Design** 🌟: Structuring data warehouse design.
4. **Data Exploration** 🔎:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Basic exploration with 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D visualizations.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Association Rule Mining.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Sequential Rule Mining.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Time Series Clustering.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• DBSCAN clustering using `KNIME`.  
5. **Modeling** with `SAS Enterprise Miner` 📈:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Decision Tree and Sequential Rule Mining.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Gradient Boosting and Association Rule Mining.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Random Forest and Association Rule Mining.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Regression and Association Rule Mining.  

## 🎯 Objective:
The primary objective is to apply and showcase a range of data mining and warehousing techniques, from initial data preparation to sophisticated modeling, in an academic context. Each step of the project, represented by the files in this repository, contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the SEMMA methodology applied to the Superstore dataset.
